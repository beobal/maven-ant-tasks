Install and Deploy

  If you want to share your built artifacts between projects, you can use two other tasks: <<<install>>> for
  installing them in your local repository for access as dependencies in other scripts, and <<<deploy>>> for
  deploying them to a remote location you have set up to serve as a repository in your organisation.

  <<Note:>> that the installation and deployment require that you have a Maven 2.0 POM file to deploy along with it.
  These are required for the transitive dependency mechanism to work effectively, and can be quite simple to
  create.

  The following example shows basic use of the <<<install>>> and <<<deploy>>> tasks.

-----
...
  <artifact:pom id="mypom" file="pom.xml" />

  <artifact:install file="target/my-project-1.0.jar">
    <pom refid="mypom"/>
  </artifact:install>

  <artifact:deploy file="target/my-project-1.0.jar">
    <remoteRepository url="file:///www/repository"/>
    <pom refid="mypom"/>
  </artifact:deploy>
...
-----

Attaching Multiple Artifacts

  The install and deploy tasks allow you to attach multiple artifact to a single deployment.  For example, 
  the sources and javadoc jars can be attached using the nested <<attach>> element.
  
-----
  <artifact:deploy file="target/my-project-1.0.jar">
    <remoteRepository url="http://localhost/www/repository"/>
    <pom refid="mypom"/>
    <attach file="${basedir}/target/my-project-1.0-sources.jar" type="jar" classifier="sources"/>
    <attach file="${basedir}/target/my-project-1.0-javadoc.jar" type="jar" classifier="javadoc"/>
    <attach file="${basedir}/target/my-project-1.0-junk.zip" type="zip" classifier="junk"/>
  </artifact:deploy>
-----

Deployment Protocols

  For deploying using a protocol other than local file system, you need to register a provider to make the other
  protocols available. For example:

-----
...
  <artifact:install-provider artifactId="wagon-ssh" version="1.0-beta-2"/>

  <artifact:deploy file="target/my-project-1.0.jar">
    <remoteRepository url="scp://localhost/www/repository">
      <authentication username="${repository.username}" privateKey="${user.home}/.ssh/id_dsa"/>
    </remoteRepository>
    <pom refid="mypom"/>
  </artifact:deploy>
...
-----

  <<Note:>> that if you use <<<antcall>>>, the provider isn't available during the Ant call: you have to register
  it again if you need it.

  ~~ TODO: Explain more thoroughly when you need to register a provider

  Maven Ant Tasks contain <<<wagon-file>>> and <<<wagon-http-lightweight>>> providers. The other available providers are:

*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| Protocol     | Artifact ID              | Version           |
*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| <<<http>>>   | <<<wagon-http>>>         | <<<1.0-beta-2>>>  |
*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| <<<scp>>>    | <<<wagon-ssh>>>          | <<<1.0-beta-2>>>  |
*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| <<<scpexe>>> | <<<wagon-ssh-external>>> | <<<1.0-beta-2>>>  |
*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| <<<ftp>>>    | <<<wagon-ftp>>>          | <<<1.0-beta-2>>>  |
*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
| <<<webdav>>> | <<<wagon-webdav>>>       | <<<1.0-beta-2>>>  |
*--------------+--------------------------+-------------------+
